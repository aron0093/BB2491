comment: PET = 2-[4-pyridyl]ethanethiol. This modification is a chemical derivative, based on a alkaline catalysed beta-elimination of phosphoserines and phosphothreonines and subsequent 1,4-addition of 2-[4-pyridine]ethanethiol. These modified serines and threonines produce in MS/MS a characteristic fragment which can be used for precursor-ion-scan experiments.
